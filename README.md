# wabisabi.css: The Beauty of Simplicity

**wabisabi.css** is more than just a stylesheet; it's a digital ode to the Japanese aesthetic philosophy of Wabi-Sabi—finding beauty in humble simplicity.

Inspired by this profound concept, this lightweight, **monochrome CSS library** embraces the raw, unadorned elegance of native HTML. We believe true beauty emerges when there's nothing left to take away.

**Key features reflecting its Wabi-Sabi inspiration:**

* **No Classes, Pure Form:** Just as Wabi-Sabi appreciates natural materials without excessive ornamentation, this library styles HTML elements directly. Your markup remains clean, semantic, and free from custom CSS classes.
* **Monochrome Serenity:** A high-contrast, black-and-white palette evokes the stark yet calming presence of old terminal interfaces, focusing attention on content rather than distraction.
* **Grayscale Harmony:** All images are automatically rendered in grayscale, unifying visuals and preventing vibrant colors from disrupting the tranquil, minimalist aesthetic.
* **Harmonious Adaptability (Light/Dark Mode):** Embracing the natural flow, the theme intelligently adjusts its monochrome palette to light or dark mode based on the user's system preferences, providing a comfortable and respectful viewing experience.
* **Humble Utility:** It provides a foundational, opinionated design that’s incredibly lightweight and efficient **(~5kb)**, encouraging thoughtful use of semantic HTML elements as they are.

wabisabi.css invites you to rediscover the inherent beauty in functional, unembellished web design. It's a testament to the idea that simplicity isn't a lack of something, but the perfect amount of everything.
